## Project Satoshi: Intermediate pt.1 tutorial
**Project Satoshi is a list of milestones an aspiring developer can self-start in order to guide themselves along a solid path to proficiency in dapp development. The list is sequential, as later milestones may depend on previous ones. It is recommended that individuals start from the beginning no matter what their level. This tutorial should be an exemplary completion of the milestone, but structured as a tutorial**

# Concepts
This tutorial should have a special focus on events and off-chain actions, async await and callbacks, parsing responses from events. In this tutorial, the reader will lean how to do the following things from your written and video tutorials:
- Implement events in a contract to feed important data to a front end to use in a meaningful way
- Use web3.js to listen to the event and parse its content

# Deliverables
- One <7min video (.mp4 or .avi), with clear English audio that can be uploaded to our YouTube channel
- One Google doc with tutorial steps and main takeaways (well-structured and concise)
- Another Google Doc whose content is a publishable blog post of the tutorial with screenshots (more detail than the previous Google doc)
- Solidity, Web3.js, and html source code with comments and correct styling

# Content completion warning
- If the tutorial does not fully cover all of the items in the Concepts section enumerated above, the bounty will not be fulfilled and payment will be zero.
