As part of our commitment to promoting the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem, Binance X has allocated funds to foster innovative projects and tools to be built on the Binance Smart Chain. These projects will be undertaken via our gitcoin tribe page at www.gitcoin.co/binancex

If you take a bounty, you must follow our guidelines as listed below, or else you risk being taken off of the bounty and forfeit payment. 

# Communicaion
- When you take a bounty, message nance2uiuc in the Gitcoin chat and have a quick chat about what you plan to do during the first week.
- We use Gitcoin chat for communication. Check it frequently.
- You must check in at least every 3 days via Gitcoin chat.
- If there is radio silence for more than 5 days, we will remove you from the bounty.
- Commits must be made at least once every 3 days.

# Documentation
- Your submission must have a clean Readme.md file with the following sections: What this is, functional documentation, build dependencies, step-by-step build/deploy instructions (for code), known bugs, future steps, email address for contact

# Payout policy
- For some bounties, we allow multiple developers to work on it and we take the best submission, paying others at our discretion.
- For single dev bounties, we reserve the right to withhold or prorate payment if the submission is of low quality, buggy, a poorly forked copy of a similar project, or if the developer refuses to fix the issues in a timely manner when given a courtesy extension.
